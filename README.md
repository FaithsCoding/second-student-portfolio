## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Actual Behaviour
A page of a portfolio has been created showcasing previously completed projects.
A recent photo of student appears, with a section about them and how to contact them with a name visible at the top of the section. 
When the links in the navigation bar are clicked the UI scrolls to the relevant section. 
The 'Home' button in the navigation bar refreshes the page. 
The most recent project completed has a larger image in comparison to two older projects. 
When the images are clicked they take you to the deployed URL allowing viewing of the full page project which is selected to open in a new tab.
When the images are hovered over they fade.
The page has been made responsive to accomodate for 3 different size screens. 
You are provided with two links in the contact me section to navigate to my GitHub or Email me with a mailto link included so it is a direct contact. 
There is a background image added in the CSS to the aside section to add some design. 
When you go to the footer you can click "Return to top" and it will navigate to the top of the page.
